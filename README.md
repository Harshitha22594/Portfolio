  - 3D tilt hover effects on cards

### 🛠 Tech Stack

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** this repository into your local machine.  
2. Ensure the file structure stays the same (HTML, CSS, JS, and image in the same folder).  
3. Open `port.html` directly in a browser, or use a local server (for best results):

```bash
# Using VS Code Live Server (recommended)
# Right-click `port.html` → "Open with Live Server"
```

### 🔧 Customization

- **Personal Info**: Update name, tagline, and about text in `port.html` (Home and About sections).
- **Experience & Education**: Modify the timeline items in the `#experience` section.
- **Projects**: Edit the cards in the `#projects` section to link to your real repositories or live demos.
- **Skills**: Adjust the chips in the `#skills` section to match your current stack.
- **Social Links**: Update email, LinkedIn URL, and phone number in the `#contact` section.
